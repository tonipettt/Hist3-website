# Mapping Memory and Community | HIST 3 Immersion

## Overview

**Mapping Memory and Community** is a curated digital immersion website designed to explore how history can be interpreted through spaces, communities, images, labor, movement, and everyday life. Rather than relying on direct field immersion, this project reconstructs historical understanding through digital materials, visual analysis, and reflective interpretation.

This website combines analytical reflection with visual storytelling to demonstrate how historians engage with memory, representation, and social realities in ordinary experiences.
